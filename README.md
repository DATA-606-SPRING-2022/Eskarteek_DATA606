# DATA606 Capstone Project

##                           Risk Management for any Organization using data analytics and Sentiment analysis 

What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?


* This project can be used to explore, analyze, and mitigate risk from various perspectives for an Organization. It is a product to which a stock symbol can be given as input and it returns an interactive UI showing the risks related to that company on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. It provides risk analysis on a real-time basis to detect potential hazards and to act faster, thus mitigating the risk. I will design an end to end system which updates based on user showing top risks on a given day, week or month, its impact on stock market and website traffic. The system would also segrigate these risks by considering all the factors into different priority levels. Also, these risks would be stored on a daily basis for furthur analysis and find frequently occuring problems in the system.

Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

* Risk management is an important procedure because it provides a company with the tools it needs to properly identify and manage potential hazards. Furthermore, management will have the essential knowledge to make informed decisions and ensure that the company remains profitable and understands problems faced by their end users.

What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?

* I would like to look at the impact of my idea when used in real-time. Its important for me to understand about what level can the risks be mitigated using a system like this. I would also like to look at the impact of social media platform like twitter, financial news on finance and users and how important is it to analyse these in risk management and mitigation.


Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?

* The twitter tweets data used for this project is fetched from Twitter Api, SimilarWeb Api for website traffic information ,Yahoo finance Api to scrape financial news and stock information. These are Api's which are legally allowed to scrape data from websites. 


What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?

* The unit of analysis here is an Organization. With my current work, my units of observation are sentiment of twitter tweets, impact on stock market and website traffic.


What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?

* I would like to look at sentiment scores, website traffic data like new customers, bounce rates,.. and yahoo financial information like impact on stock prices, polarity of financial news, and more. 

What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?

* NLP (Sentiment analysis)

How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?

* I would like to use VADAR sentiment analyser to analyse sentiment in the data. User Keyword extraction techniques like TF-IDF on negetive tweets to find out the most important issues to be solved on a given day. 

What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?

* I would like to understand the impact of this project and predictive analytics in real-time application.
